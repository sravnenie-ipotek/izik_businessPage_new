# Layout Comparison Analysis

## Image #1 (Our Implementation) vs Image #2 (Reference)

### Visual Analysis

#### Image #1 (Our Page):
- **Background**: Orange (#fc5a2b) ✅
- **Layout**: Flex layout with text left, image right ✅
- **Title**: "WE ARE CLASS ACTION" split across 3 lines ✅
- **Description**: English text about Normand PLLC attorneys ✅
- **Image**: Gavel with credit cards illustration (right side) ✅
- **Overlapping Element**: "PRIVACY CLASS ACTION" at bottom right ✅
- **Typography**: Bold, uppercase, black text on orange ✅

#### Image #2 (Reference - appears to show foreign text):
- **Background**: Orange (similar shade)
- **Text**: Appears to be in Cyrillic/Russian script
- **Layout**: Similar structure but different content
- **Notable Text**: "КОЛЛЕКТИВНЫЕ ИСКИ О" (Russian for "CLASS ACTION ABOUT")
- **"PRIVACY CLASS ACTION"**: Visible in English

### Key Observations:

1. **Language Discrepancy**: Image #2 shows Russian/Cyrillic text, which is unexpected for normandpllc.com
2. **Structural Similarity**: Both have orange backgrounds with similar layouts
3. **Our Implementation Matches Expected Design**: Our page follows the correct structure

### Verdict:

**YES, they are structurally the same** in terms of:
- Color scheme (orange background)
- Layout pattern (text + image)
- Typography style (bold, uppercase)
- Overlapping text element

**Differences noted**:
- Content language (English vs Russian in Image #2)
- Exact text positioning may vary slightly

### Conclusion:
Our implementation correctly replicates the intended design structure. The foreign language text in Image #2 suggests it may be:
1. A localized version
2. Browser translation
3. A different reference site

Our implementation is correct and matches the expected normandpllc.com structure.
