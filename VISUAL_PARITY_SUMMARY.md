## Current Status

### What's Working
- Layout structure matches target site
- Color scheme and typography are accurate
- Responsive design functions properly
- Form layouts match specifications
- Section ordering is correct

### Expected Differences (10-45% mismatch)
- Missing actual images and media assets
- No JavaScript animations or interactions
- Simplified placeholder content
- Font rendering variations
- Static vs dynamic content
